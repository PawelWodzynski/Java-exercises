Some exercises in Java

This repository will contain all my Java tutorials as well as my own scripts.

As a rule, my day looks like this: I read a book about Java in the morning, sit down at the computer, start a practical course with previously prepared theoretical knowledge, try to understand the written script with the teacher as much as possible, analyze what is happening in the script and often on the same day I start your own script based on the acquired knowledge.

It is very important.
Programming often uses solutions to problems that someone else has already solved. 
No need to reinvent the wheel :)
